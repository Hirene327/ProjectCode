          <div class="mission-con">
            <h7 class="mission-description"> The Mitoyaki product is the new approach of combining famous meatballs and takoyaki into one yet broad mix. This enables new products for everyone who is looking for new food that is also affordable. With this unique product, Mitoyaki will provide distinctive yet identifiable flavors at competitive prices for everyone's consumption. 
            </h7></div>

            <div class="mission-con">
              <h7 class="mission-description"> Mitoyaki will also consist of many combinations, such as Japanese sushi style, French tomato top style, Swedish style, and more. This thus increases variations for a tasteful meatball-Takoyaki combo, alongside different styles that will suit the masses. Customers can also request customizations on their products to suit their tastes. We will also sell fries and drinks as our side products, which may even be part of our meatball-Takoyaki combo. These customizations can vary from one style to another, depending on additional customer preferences and the price of the product. 
              </h7></div>
        
          <div class="mission-con" >
            <h7 class="mission-description">Our business model is dependent on our marketing strategy. It is a customer-friendly business model that will allow the customers to easily choose products to be delivered for convenience and for their stay in our establishments to be enjoyable as well. Advertising is also the key to our market reach. We will also follow the "less price, sell more" policy as our strategy to gain more profit and customers. Customer satisfaction, comfort, and recommendations are our main goals for having good service and a customer-friendly restaurant.
