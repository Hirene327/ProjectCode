          <h7 class="mission-description">  Our restaurant will have a minimalist interior and exterior design. We are also going to put some plants in the restaurant so that it will be more alive when you enter. The color of the restaurant will be gray and yellow, and it will be designed as how Japanese restaurants look in the modern era. The entertainment of the customers is one of the main goals of the design, which is to add a sound system alongside televisions while customers wait and eat. It will surely be aesthetic in all places or corners of our restaurant so that the customers who like to take pictures will be satisfied with our restaurant as well as being satisfied offline. </h7>

If they are regular and loyal customers, we will give them a loyalty card that will give them discounts as they buy.
