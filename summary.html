We combined the fried meatballs with onions and onion springs sauced in Takoyaki style. It can also be combined with potatoes and fries in the balls. We can also add vegetables, mayonnaise, mustard, or ketchup as the customer prefers. Mitoyaki aims to serve unique and affordable snacks to every Filipino and to people around the world.
